Check: 
	• Type conflict between the two sides of an AssertionForm
			• the value and the type of each side will be printed (also if a side is empty it'll be signaled)
	• Every side is null -> rivaluta!
	• Wrong operation between sides (ex. "str1">"str" has no sense here) for Strings, Booleans, Doubles and DataObject
			• the value and the type of each side will be printed
	• Variables used in an Assertion are defined
	• Variable used in a QuantifiedAssertion is a DataObject (and so iterable)
	• Variable used in a QuantifiedAssertion for the 'alias' variable is not in use
	• Objects contained in the variable used in a QuantifiedAssertion are of the right type (ex. 'sum(...)' could not sum string)
	• Number of parameter and type of parameters [applyXFunctions()]
	• Variable already used [setVariable()]
	• Variable not defined when evaluating an Assertion based on it [setVariable()] 
	• Key not found in DataObject [-> DataObject]
	•
