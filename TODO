	• Better syntax errors messages: hints on possible solutions
	• Make some junit tests for the query
	• Make a clean project: new project importing the grammar jar and throw methods outside Main.java!

 	• Add complex assertions even in the declarations -> is it useful?
	• Variables in Values -> what's happening if I put a variable referring to a DataObject? What if I call an 'exists' over it?
	• Add variables and functions in Step's attribute (ex. /step[$a.lengt()] is, for now, invalid) -> is it useful?

 	• Base rules of the grammar (...)
 	• Make a TODO list :)
 	• Rules for make assertions with AND, OR and NOT (with the corresponding priority: NOT > AND > OR)
 	• Rules for quantified assertions 'forall', 'exists' and 'numOf'
 	• Runtime errors (ex. quantified assertion over a single value variable and not on a set of value) throws exception with a corresponding message
 	• Implementation of rules for 'max', 'min', 'avg', 'sum' and 'product'
 		• BUT with the correction of the rule Variable ('min', 'max', etc are now language keyword, so I could not declare a variable '$min' without correcting the Variable rule)
 		• BUT float numbers could be different for a minimum fraction, maybe we can use a limited number of decimal digit 
 	• Make the boolean value in AssertionForm implicit (ex. exists(...) = true -> exists(...))
 		• BUT rules are not so pretty...
 	• Better syntax errors messages: what and why is wrong; also for runtime errors with values printing
